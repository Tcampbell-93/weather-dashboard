# weather-dashboard

## Description
This project is a weather dashboard that I created. You can search for the weather of any U.S. or E.U. city and get a 5 day forecast that city.
In this project I learned how to make API calls and use the returned data to upload to my page. This was a fun project for me because I feel like 
I learned a lot about API servers. 

## Usage
In the opening page you can search for a city and it will redirect you to another page that displays a 5 day forecast for the weather.
In the left hand sidebar you can search for a different city. It also saves the cities that you have previously searched in your local 
storage. They will display on the left hand side as buttons and you can click on them to go back to the forecast for those cities.
